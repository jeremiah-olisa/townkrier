# Multi-Adapter Configuration - Implementation Complete

## Summary

Successfully implemented multi-adapter support with automatic fallback for the Townkrier notification system. This allows users to configure multiple service providers for each notification channel (e.g., Resend → SMTP for email) with automatic failover if the primary provider fails.

## What Was Changed

### 1. Configuration System

**File:** `packages/core/src/interfaces/notification-config.interface.ts`

- Added `AdapterConfig` interface to define individual adapters within a channel
- Updated `ChannelConfig` to support an `adapters` array alongside the legacy `config` property
- Maintains 100% backward compatibility with existing single-adapter configurations

**Example:**

```typescript
{
  name: 'email',
  enabled: true,
  adapters: [
    { name: 'resend', priority: 10, config: { apiKey: '...' } },
    { name: 'smtp', priority: 5, config: { host: '...' } },
  ]
}
```

### 2. NotificationManager Core Logic

**File:** `packages/core/src/core/notification-manager.ts`

**New Features:**

- `channelAdapters` map to store multiple adapters per channel
- `getAdapterKey()` helper method for consistent adapter key generation
- `sendWithAdapterFallback()` method that tries adapters in priority order
- Enhanced error tracking that includes both failed and skipped (not ready) adapters
- Updated `send()` method to automatically use adapter fallback when multiple adapters are configured

**Key Improvements:**

- Adapters are sorted by priority during registration (higher priority = tried first)
- Automatic fallback through all configured adapters
- Comprehensive error reporting showing all attempts
- No breaking changes to existing API

### 3. Security Fix

**File:** `packages/core/src/utils/index.ts`

**Fixed ReDoS Vulnerability:**

- **Old regex:** `/^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$/` (vulnerable to catastrophic backtracking)
- **New regex:** `/^[a-zA-Z0-9!#$%&'*+/=?^_`{|}~-]{1,64}(?:\.[a-zA-Z0-9!#$%&'*+/=?^_`{|}~-]{1,64})_@[a-zA-Z0-9](?:[a-zA-Z0-9-]{0,61}[a-zA-Z0-9])?(?:\.[a-zA-Z0-9](?:[a-zA-Z0-9-]{0,61}[a-zA-Z0-9])?)_$/`

**Why this is better:**

- Uses specific character classes with bounded quantifiers
- Prevents catastrophic backtracking on malicious inputs
- Follows RFC 5322 more closely
- Still validates real-world email addresses correctly

### 4. Comprehensive Testing

**File:** `packages/core/src/__tests__/adapter-fallback.test.ts`

**Added 9 new tests covering:**

- Multiple adapter configuration
- Priority-based ordering
- Fallback when primary adapter fails
- Cascading fallback through all adapters
- Skipping disabled adapters
- Error handling when all adapters fail
- Legacy configuration support
- Direct use of `sendWithAdapterFallback()` method

**Test Results:**

- ✅ 30/30 tests passing (21 existing + 9 new)
- ✅ 100% backward compatibility maintained

## How It Works

### Registration Phase

```typescript
const manager = new NotificationManager({
  channels: [{
    name: 'email',
    adapters: [
      { name: 'resend', priority: 10, config: {...} },
      { name: 'smtp', priority: 5, config: {...} }
    ]
  }]
});

manager.registerFactory('resend', createResendChannel);
manager.registerFactory('smtp', createSmtpChannel);
```

**What happens:**

1. Config is stored in `channelConfigs` map
2. When `registerFactory()` is called, it matches adapter names
3. Adapters are sorted by priority (highest first)
4. Each adapter is instantiated and stored in `channelAdapters` map
5. Adapters are also registered in `channels` map with full key (e.g., "email-resend")

### Sending Phase

```typescript
await manager.send(notification, recipient);
```

**What happens:**

1. `send()` checks if channel has multiple adapters
2. If yes, calls `sendWithAdapterFallback()`
3. Tries each adapter in priority order:
   - Skip if not ready (tracked in errors)
   - Try to send
   - If success, return immediately
   - If failure, log error and try next
4. If all fail, throw comprehensive error with all attempts

## Validation Results

### Build & Tests

```
✅ Build: All 9 packages build successfully
✅ Tests: 30/30 tests pass
✅ Lint: All lint checks pass
```

### Security Scan

```
✅ CodeQL: 0 security alerts
   - ReDoS vulnerability fixed and verified
   - No new security issues introduced
```

### Code Review

```
✅ All feedback addressed:
   - Added getAdapterKey() helper method
   - Enhanced error tracking for skipped adapters
   - Added clarifying comments about sorting
   - Improved debugging capability
```

## Migration Guide

### For Existing Users (No Changes Required)

Your existing configuration continues to work:

```typescript
// This still works exactly as before
{
  name: 'email-resend',
  enabled: true,
  config: { apiKey: '...' }
}
```

### For New Multi-Adapter Setup

```typescript
// New way - multiple adapters with fallback
{
  name: 'email',
  enabled: true,
  adapters: [
    {
      name: 'resend',
      priority: 10,  // Primary
      config: { apiKey: process.env.RESEND_API_KEY }
    },
    {
      name: 'smtp',
      priority: 5,  // Fallback
      config: {
        host: process.env.SMTP_HOST,
        port: 587,
        auth: { user: '...', pass: '...' }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Reliability:** Automatic failover if primary service is down
2. **Cost Optimization:** Use cheaper fallback for non-critical notifications
3. **Rate Limiting:** Automatically switch when hitting rate limits
4. **Geographic Distribution:** Primary in one region, fallback in another
5. **Testing:** Easy to test different providers without code changes
6. **Gradual Migration:** Slowly move traffic from one provider to another

## Custom Channel Support

Users can now easily create custom channels (VoIP, social media, etc.) by:

1. Creating a base channel class extending `BaseNotificationChannel`
2. Implementing specific adapter classes for different providers
3. Registering factories with the manager
4. Configuring adapters with priorities for fallback

See `docs/CUSTOM_CHANNELS_AND_ADAPTERS.md` for complete examples.

## Performance Impact

- **Minimal:** Only adds adapter lookup on registration (one-time cost)
- **Runtime:** No overhead for single-adapter setups (backward compatible path)
- **Multi-adapter:** Negligible overhead (simple array iteration until success)

## Breaking Changes

**None.** This is a fully backward-compatible enhancement.

## Files Changed

1. `packages/core/src/interfaces/notification-config.interface.ts` (+25 lines)
2. `packages/core/src/core/notification-manager.ts` (+150 lines)
3. `packages/core/src/utils/index.ts` (security fix, 5 lines changed)
